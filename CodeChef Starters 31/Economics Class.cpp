Alice has recently learned in her economics class that the market is said to be in equilibrium when the supply is equal to the demand.

Alice has market data for $N$ time points in the form of two integer arrays $S$ and $D$. Here, $S_i$ denotes the supply at the $i^{th}$ point of time and $D_i$ denotes the demand at the $i^{th}$ point of time, for each $1 \leq i \leq N$.

Help Alice in finding out the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer $T$ â€” the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
Each test case contains three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$, the length of the arrays $S$ and $D$.
The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $S_1, S_2, \ldots , S_N$.
The third line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $D_1, D_2, \ldots , D_N$.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.

Constraints
$1 \leq T \leq 10$
$1 \leq N \leq 100$
$1 \leq S_i, D_i \leq 100$ for every $1 \leq i \leq N$

Explanation
Test case $1$: For $i = 3$ and $i = 4$, we have supply equal to demand, hence the market is in equilibrium.

Test case $2$: For $i = 1$, we have supply equal to demand, hence the market is in equilibrium.
