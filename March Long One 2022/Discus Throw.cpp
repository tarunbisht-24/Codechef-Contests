/*
In discus throw, a player is given 3 throws and the throw with the longest distance is regarded as their final score.

You are given the distances for all 3 throws of a player. Determine the final score of the player.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, three integers A,B, and C denoting the distances in each throw.
Output Format
For each test case, output the final score of the player.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤A,B,C≤100
Sample Input 1 
3
10 15 8
32 32 32
82 45 54
Sample Output 1 
15
32
82
Explanation
Test Case 1: The longest distance is achieved in the second throw, which is equal to 15 units. Thus, the answer is 15.

Test Case 2: In all throws, the distance is 32 units. Thus, the final score is 32.
